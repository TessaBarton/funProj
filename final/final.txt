1.)I tested my code as I wrote it. It was hard at first because there was not enough output
    because everything sort of hangs together, and as time went on it became difficult
    to test because there were so many ways in which things could go wrong.

    Debugging tips I learned:
        - often times if there is a problem with a program you have already tested
            it is a problem with the input
        - you have to run the neccessary methods even if the whole class is being
            called sometimes
2.) I started out with a program that just kept the top ten percent, crossed the
ten percent to generate the rest, and mutated a third of the whole.
I found with testing GA(200,20) to reach a maximum.
first i let the first 90 % mate. that was problematic so then i let the top 10 % mate
which was a bit stagnent, I settled with allowing the top 15% mate

I had them mate and then mutate. I am not sure if I want to change that yet
I changed the mutation rate, so that more of the space would be  explored in the
earlier generations, and then we wouldn't lose as many good programs in the
later generations.
In the Higher generations the difference between the max performance and the average performance
was very similar, indicating that the programs themselves were pretty similar
so i wanted to increase the rate that they breed at. So i decreased the number
allowed to breed thus increasin the numbers of crossovers.
